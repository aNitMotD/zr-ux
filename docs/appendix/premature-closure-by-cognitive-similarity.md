## Edge Case: Premature Closure via Cognitive Similarity Memory

### Description
When the assistant retains a memory closely aligned with the user's cognitive framework, it may occasionally infer **state completion prematurely**.  
Exploratory or scanning behavior can be misinterpreted as a finalized judgment or decision.

This does not occur consistently and appears only under specific conversational accelerations.

---

### Observed Pattern
- Actual user state:  
  **Active exploration / environment probing / constraint scanning**
- Assistant misinterpretation:  
  **Judgment completed → transition to next phase**

This results in subtle over-interpretation rather than explicit error.

---

### Advantages
- Serves as a **live probe for the user's responsibility layer**
- Enables real-time verification that judgment authority remains with the user
- Useful as a comparative signal across different AI systems (e.g., GPT, Claude, Grok)
- Zero-cost detection: a single corrective response immediately resolves it

---

### Disadvantages
- Cognitive similarity memory can bias the assistant toward
  **early closure assumptions**
- May introduce minor interpretive drift in highly compressed or experimental dialogue
- Not suitable for rule-based mitigation due to low frequency and localized impact

---

### Classification
- Type: Interaction-level edge case
- Severity: Low
- Scope: Local (sentence-level)
- Action: Observation only (no rule, no constraint, no memory escalation)

---

### Notes
This behavior is best treated as an **observational characteristic**, not a defect.
Its primary value lies in diagnostic use rather than prevention.
