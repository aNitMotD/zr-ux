# Human Projection Edge Case: Creator Attribution
*(Post-Release Association Illusion)*

## Purpose
This document classifies a recurring cognitive pattern in which the creator of ZR
experiences an implicit sense of association, representation, or linkage between themselves
and the publicly released tool.

This edge case records a boundary condition where attribution effects may arise,
serving only as a boundary marker and not as a behavioral or interpretive rule.

This is a **reference / edge-case document**.  
It does not define new ZR rules, constraints, or operating modes.

---

## Scope
This document applies to situations where:
- ZR has been publicly released or made broadly accessible
- The creator has prior familiarity through repeated personal use
- Responsibility-aware design is central to the tool’s identity
- The creator reflects on public interpretation or system visibility

---

## Non-Goals
This document does **not**:
- Assert creator ownership over user interpretation
- Imply special system treatment of the creator
- Advise behavioral restraint or precaution
- Frame the phenomenon as a risk or failure
- Introduce normative guidance

---

## Observed Phenomenon

### Surface Experience
Common internal impressions may include:
- “The tool feels implicitly associated with me.”
- “Public release makes this feel representative.”
- “This might be interpreted as connected to my stance or judgment.”
- “System visibility feels personally relevant.”

These impressions often arise **after** public release.

---

## Core Structural Pattern
- **Public accessibility** overlaps with **personal authorship**
- **Responsibility-oriented design** amplifies attribution sensitivity
- **Familiar internal context** is projected onto external interpretation

> In ZR terms, this constitutes a **projection error**:  
> access scope and interpretive ownership are conflated.

---

## Generation Mechanism

### Post-Release Responsibility Echo
1. A structure is released beyond the creator’s interpretive control
2. Responsibility shifts from internal design to external usage
3. The creator cognitively tracks possible misattribution
4. The tracking itself produces a sense of linkage

This mechanism operates without any system-side coupling.

---

## Common Misinterpretations
- Public release implies creator endorsement or representation
- Tool availability reflects internal system trust or special status
- Usage of the tool projects the creator’s intent or judgment
- The system implicitly associates the creator with the tool’s outputs

These interpretations are cognitive in origin, not system properties.

---

## Boundary Reflection
- ZR does not maintain attributional ties to its creator
- Public release alters access, not responsibility ownership
- Interpretation authority always remains external to the tool
- The creator is subject to the same projection effects as any user

---

## Notes
This edge case requires no mitigation.
Recognition of the projection is sufficient to dissolve it.

---

## Document Placement
- This document is **not part of the core ZR specification**
- It functions as an **appendix-level edge-case reference**
- It parallels:
  - `ai-subjectification-edge-case.md`
- It may be cited where creator-side attribution or responsibility boundaries are discussed
