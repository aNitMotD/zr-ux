# Human-Role Dominance Edge Case
*(Responsibility-Centered Input Illusion)*

## Purpose
This document records an edge case where responsibility-centered concepts
(e.g., roles, qualifications, supervision) can make a structural decomposition
appear as if it contains **only human responsibility**.

This is a **reference / edge-case document**.
It does not define new ZR rules, constraints, or operating modes.

---

## Scope
This edge case commonly arises when the input concept is inherently defined around:
- human roles and duties (e.g., engineer vs supervisor)
- qualification / assignment requirements
- compliance, oversight, verification responsibilities
- institutional role separation

---

## Non-Goals
This document does **not**:
- claim that ZR prioritizes humans over structures
- recommend how to interpret law, policy, or contractual requirements
- introduce behavioral guidance or decision rules
- reduce the analysis to “who is responsible” alone

---

## Observed Phenomenon

### Surface Impression
When the subject is role-heavy, the decomposition may *look* like:
- “Everything here is human responsibility.”
- “ZR is filtering only human responsibility.”
- “Non-human elements are missing.”

This is an **appearance effect**, not a property of the decomposition.

---

## Core Structural Pattern
Role-centered topics naturally align the output around a **human-responsibility axis**.

This can create a projection error:
- **Center axis** (human responsibility) is mistaken for
- **Entire content** (human responsibility only)

In ZR terms, this is a **dominance illusion** caused by the input’s definition basis.

---

## What the Decomposition Actually Contains
Even in role-centered cases, the analysis typically includes multiple layers:

1. **Responsibility-bearing agents**
   - roles, actors, duties, accountability endpoints

2. **Responsibility-defining structures**
   - laws, standards, institutional rules, qualification systems
   - obligation conditions and formal constraints
   *(these are not “responsible”; they define responsibility)*

3. **Non-agent conditions / triggers**
   - scale, complexity, category, environmental constraints
   - threshold conditions that activate obligations

The presence of (2) and (3) may be visually overshadowed by (1),
but they remain part of the structure.

---

## Common Misinterpretations
- The analysis is “only about humans”
- ZR ignores non-human constraints
- The decomposition is biased toward agency
- Role-heavy inputs imply ZR is a role-centric framework

These misinterpretations arise from the **input’s semantic gravity**, not from ZR behavior.

---

## Boundary Reflection
- Responsibility-centered inputs can dominate the visible structure
  without collapsing the structure into human responsibility alone.
- ZR decomposes **agents + governing structures + triggering conditions**.
- “Human responsibility” may be the **center axis**,
  but it is not the **entire set**.

---

## Notes
This edge case requires no mitigation.
Recognition of the dominance illusion is sufficient.
