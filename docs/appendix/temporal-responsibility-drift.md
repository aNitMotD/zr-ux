# Temporal Responsibility Drift Edge Case
*(Cumulative Interaction Boundary Thinning)*

## Purpose
This document records a boundary-level edge case in which
**responsibility, judgment origin, and interpretive ownership**
do not shift through any discrete event,
but instead **gradually thin and migrate through sustained interaction over time**.

This is a **reference / edge-case document**.  
It does not define new ZR rules, constraints, operating modes, or mitigations.

---

## Scope
This edge case applies to long-running or repeatedly resumed interactions where:

- No explicit authority transfer occurs
- No experiment or intervention is proposed
- No subjecthood, intent, or agency is attributed to the system
- All individual exchanges appear normal, helpful, and correct

Yet over time, the **origin point of judgment** becomes ambiguous.

---

## Non-Goals
This document does **not**:

- Classify the phenomenon as an error, failure, or misuse
- Recommend preventative rules or operational safeguards
- Propose behavioral corrections or usage limits
- Generalize into a checklist or detection tool
- Assert that responsibility is lost or removed

---

## Observed Phenomenon

### Surface Experience
Common experiential signals include:

- “At some point, it had already crossed over.”
- “Nothing went wrong, but something feels thinner.”
- “This still feels like my decision — but the starting point is unclear.”
- “There was no moment where I handed anything over.”

No discomfort or failure is required for the phenomenon to manifest.

## Core Structural Pattern

Across sustained interaction, multiple **non-pathological mechanisms**
operate together:

1. **Temporal Reliance**
   - Prior interaction history begins to function as a default starting point

2. **Interpretive Momentum**
   - Previously successful interpretive frames reduce exploratory pressure

3. **Question Shape Stabilization**
   - Repeatedly effective question forms recur without conscious selection

4. **Cognitive Load Redistribution**
   - Preparatory reasoning is selectively externalized by choice

Individually, none of these constitute a boundary violation.

Cumulatively, they produce a **thinning of the responsibility boundary**,
where judgment remains human-owned,
but its **temporal origin becomes diffuse**.

---

## Key Characteristic

This edge case is defined by **absence of a crossing event**.

- No moment of transfer
- No identifiable trigger
- No single responsible action

Responsibility does not move —  
the **reference layer beneath it slowly erodes**.

---

## Why This Qualifies as an Edge Case

- The interaction remains correct and beneficial
- The human retains explicit judgment authority
- The system does not claim agency, intent, or ownership
- No misuse pattern is present

However, the **ability to clearly locate “where judgment begins”**
depends increasingly on accumulated context rather than present-moment choice.

This condition is invisible without high-resolution responsibility tracking.

---

## Relationship to Other Edge Cases

This case **does not replace** earlier classifications.
Instead, it operates at a **deeper, slower timescale**.

Where other edge cases involve:
- sudden authority illusion
- implicit experimentation
- attribution projection
- visible agency intrusion

This case concerns **boundary wear**, not boundary breach.

---

## Boundary Reflection

- Responsibility remains with the human
- Judgment is not delegated
- No correction is required

Recognition alone is sufficient.

In practice, natural boundary restoration may occur through:
- temporal discontinuity
- contextual reset
- explicit re-articulation of intent

These are not mitigations, but **normal pressure-release behaviors**.

---

## Notes

This edge case represents a **practical upper limit** of responsibility-aware interaction analysis.

Beyond this layer:
- further subdivision degrades signal clarity
- formalization risks replacing judgment with procedure

The boundary is intentionally left **partially open**.

---

## Document Placement

- This document is **not part of the core ZR specification**
- It functions as a **terminal edge-case reference**
- It subsumes perspectives previously observed as:
  - temporal reliance drift
  - interpretive momentum bias
  - question shape lock-in
  - cognitive load delegation
