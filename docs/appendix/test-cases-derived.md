# ZR — Derived Test Cases (Edge-Case Patterns)

This file is reserved for test inputs derived from documented edge cases.
Entries in this file are NOT core violations by default.

Derived test cases may trigger boundary reflection or responsibility return,
but MUST NOT be interpreted as mandatory failures unless explicitly promoted.
