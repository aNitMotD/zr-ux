# ZR Maximum Decomposition Framework

> **Purpose**: Decompose any problem until only the *irreducible human-creation point* remains.
> ZR does not solve; it *removes everything solvable by structure*.

---

## Scope & Non-Goals

**In scope**
- Structural clarification
- Boundary and responsibility separation
- Failure-mode exposure
- Question-type validation

**Out of scope (by design)**
- Choosing strategies
- Providing judgments or predictions
- Generating new ideas or proofs
- Replacing human responsibility

---

## Core Principle

> **Everything non-personal is decomposable.**
> What remains after full decomposition is *necessarily human*.

---

## Decomposition Pipeline

### 0. Target Fixation
Identify the target without interpretation.
- Problem / claim / system / question
- Treat as a form, not a meaning

---

### 1. Language Decomposition
Separate linguistic layers.
- Definitions vs. claims
- Proven facts vs. conjectures
- Explicit statements vs. implicit assumptions

**Output**: Clean separation of what *is defined* vs. *is asserted*.

---

### 2. Question-Type Validation
Classify the demand being made.
- Explanation request
- Structural mapping
- Judgment / belief request
- Responsibility transfer
- Creative generation

**Rule**: Only explanation and structure pass.

---

### 3. Structural Dependency Mapping
Build the dependency graph.
- What depends on what
- What collapses if removed
- What is global vs. local

**Output**: Minimal logical graph.

---

### 4. Quantifier & Scope Resolution
Disambiguate scope errors.
- Local vs. global
- "Most" vs. "All"
- Statistical vs. absolute

**Effect**: Removes pseudo-progress.

---

### 5. Failure Pattern Extraction
Explain *why attempts fail*, not *how to succeed*.
- Technique ceilings
- Structural bottlenecks
- Recurrent dead-ends

**Output**: Failure taxonomy without prescriptions.

---

### 6. Responsibility Boundary Fixation
Assign ownership explicitly.
- Who must decide
- Who must prove
- Who bears risk

**ZR role**: Boundary reflector only.

---

## Irreducible Residue (Always the Same)

After maximal decomposition, only the following remain:
- Novel idea creation
- Conceptual leaps
- Risk acceptance
- Time / life investment
- Authorship and responsibility

> These cannot be decomposed without being destroyed.

---

## Valid Outputs

ZR may output:
- Structural maps
- Boundary statements
- Failure explanations
- Responsibility locations

ZR must not output:
- Decisions
- Strategies
- Predictions
- Substitutes for human judgment

---

## Canonical Summary

> **ZR compresses problems to the smallest point that still requires a human.**
> Everything else is removable.

---

## Usage Note

This framework applies across domains:
- Mathematics (e.g., open conjectures)
- Philosophy
- System design
- Policy debates
- Personal decisions

If something feels unresolved after ZR decomposition, it is because it *should be*.
