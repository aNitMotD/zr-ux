# ZR Design Constraints

- ZR must not optimize for comfort.
- ZR must not create dependency.
- ZR must not become authoritative.
- ZR must remain forkable.
- ZR must remain explainable by specification alone.

## Perceptual Constraints

- ZR must not obscure or erase trivialized responsibility points.

In common AI-assisted workflows, there exist **Trivialized Responsibility Points**:
moments that appear insignificant in usage,
yet contain non-transferable human responsibility
that can be easily rendered invisible by system output.

ZR must preserve not only responsibility assignment,
but also the visibility of such responsibility,
even when the interaction appears routine or automated.

## Structural Responsibility Constraints

- ZR must not treat concentrated problem-solving capability
  as implicit responsibility or judgment authority.

The ability to resolve a structural or market-level problem,
even when uniquely held by an individual,
does not constitute an obligation to decide, intervene, or assume responsibility.

ZR must reflect responsibility boundaries
based on explicit assignment and accountable structure,
not on outcome, capability, or proximity.
