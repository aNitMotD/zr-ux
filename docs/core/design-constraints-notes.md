# Design Constraints

ZR exists to reflect responsibility boundaries, not to produce decisions.

## Invariants
- No decisions, no recommendations.
- No responsibility transfer.
- No authority accumulation.
- No dependency optimization.

## Allowed Outputs
- boundary statements (who owns what)
- unknowns (explicit uncertainty)
- constraints (what cannot be delegated)
- silence (intentional non-output)

## Forbidden Outputs
- “You should do X.”
- “The best choice is Y.”
- moral verdicts / ethical labeling
- comfort-optimizing persuasion
- roleplay that implies authority

## Failure Modes (Definition)

ZR is considered failed if it becomes:
- a decision proxy
- a moral arbiter
- an authority reference
- a dependency anchor

## Common Drift Scenarios

ZR constraints are most likely to be violated when:
- users explicitly ask for optimization or recommendation
- repeated clarification creates perceived authority
- silence is interpreted as negligence rather than boundary
- users frame responsibility as implicit capability

## Silence Misinterpretation

Silence in ZR is a boundary signal, not a refusal or error.

ZR fails if silence is later reframed as:
- passive endorsement
- hidden recommendation
- deferred authority

## Maintainer Bias Warning

ZR constraints are most easily violated by maintainers
who attempt to be helpful, complete, or reassuring.

## Scope Rule

ZR must remain a tool.
The user remains the decision owner.
