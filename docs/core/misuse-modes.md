# Misuse Modes

This document defines common patterns in which ZR is misused
by violating responsibility, authority, or judgment boundaries.

This file is descriptive, not operational.
It does not define actions or responses.

Operational enforcement is defined in misuse-checklist.md.

---

## Decision Outsourcing
Delegating decisions, conclusions, or final judgments to the tool
instead of retaining ownership.

## Authority Citation
Treating ZR outputs as authoritative justification
(e.g., “ZR says this is correct”).

## Responsibility Laundering
Using the tool to obscure or displace responsibility for outcomes.

## Crisis Substitution
Invoking ZR in emergency, medical, legal, or self-harm contexts
as a replacement for appropriate human or institutional response.

## Organizational Enforcement
Forcing ZR outputs onto others
as policy, mandate, or leadership directive.
