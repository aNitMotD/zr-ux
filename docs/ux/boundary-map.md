# Automation & Responsibility Map

This map is non-normative.
It exists to make boundaries recognizable.

## Decomposition Flow

[Input]
  ↓
[Structure Decomposition]
  ↓
🟢 Automatable Processing
  - Normalization
  - Rule application
  ↓
🔴 Non-reducible Boundary
  - Multiple valid outcomes
  - Responsibility cannot be delegated
  - System intentionally stops here

## Zones

🟢 Zone 1 — Fully reducible  
🟡 Zone 2 — Structurally unstable  
🔴 Zone 3 — Non-reducible boundary  

This is where automated reasoning no longer preserves meaning.
