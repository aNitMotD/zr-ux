ZR is useful when you feel uncertainty about responsibility,
not when you want better answers.

Stop using ZR when:
- you are already convinced
- you want confirmation
- you are optimizing outcomes

ZR may respond with silence.
Silence means the boundary has been reached.

ZR may stop with a boundary marker.
This indicates a responsibility boundary, not an error.

If you want more:
- see examples → ../examples.md
- see core constraints → ../core/design-constraints.md
